          <div class="faq-answer">
            Not at all! We cater to users of all experience levels. For beginners, we offer educational

            What's the minimum amount I need to start trading?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This varies by platform. Many of our recommended trading platforms allow you to start with 
            as little as $100-$250. Some even offer demo accounts so you can practice with virtual money 
            before risking real capital. We always recommend starting small and only investing what you 
            can afford to lose.

            Account setup typically takes 5-15 minutes for most platforms. However, KYC (Know Your Customer) 
            verification can take 24-48 hours depending on the platform's compliance procedures. We provide 
            guidance on what documents you'll need to expedite the process.

            trading, and a portfolio manager to track your overall investments. We can help you choose

            Costs vary by product and platform. Some services are free (like basic digital wallets), 
            while others charge monthly subscriptions ($49-$99/month for premium tools) or one-time fees 
            (like our $299 Education Bundle). We always disclose all costs upfront and help you find 
            options that fit your budget.
